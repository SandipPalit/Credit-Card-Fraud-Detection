# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Credit card fraud detection is the process of identifying purchase attempts that are fraudulent and rejecting them rather than processing the order. It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. In this notebook, we will use Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques like Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor to detect the outliers.
